# Ironhack Data Analytics Labs

## Getting Started

1. Install **git** following the instructions included [here](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git). If you're using Ubuntu you can just:

```
$ sudo apt install git-all
```

1. Fork this repository to your GitHub account and clone the forked repository into your local Hard Drive:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/<your-account>/<lab-repo>.git
```
Git will create a new folder named as the repository you're cloning and will convert it automatically into a git repository.

2. Once you're into your newly created folder (repository) you can create a new branch for start an assignment:

```
$ git checkout -b <lab-name>
```

Each project/lab has its own directory in which you'll find a `README.md` file and, in most of them, a sub-directory named `your-code`. The descriptions and requirements of the assignment can be found in the README file. When you work on the assignment, create your code files in the `your-code` directory and save regularly while you work using:

```
$ git add <files-to-add>
$ git commit -m "lab-started"
$ git push origin <branch-name>
```

After you finish, perform a last commit as follow:

```
$ git add <files-to-add>
$ git commit -m "lab-finished"
$ git push origin <branch-name>
```

The instructional team will review your branch and provide feedback.

**To work on the subsequent assignments**, create a new branch for every new assignment.

:exclamation: You may be asked in the future to update your forked repo because the curriculum development team is developing new assignments for you as the course proceeds. 

### Happy coding!
